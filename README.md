# tindog

This website was developed along with App Brewery's Web Development Bootcamp, mentored by Angela Yu.

While presenting a fresh take of tinder (here called tindog), this project taught be about many CSS concepts such as:
- Bootstrap Grid System;
- Responsiveness using media query;
- Combining selectors and it's priorities;
- How to work accurately with CSS Box Model;
- Taking advantage of bootstrap default classes;
- and much more.

The website it not functional, it was developed only to focus on the HTML and CSS phase.
